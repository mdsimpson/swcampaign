# Background

In my community, called "Southern Walk" we have a legal entity incorporated as a Homeowners Association (HOA).
This is called the "Southern Walk Homeowners Association," and is abbreviated as "SWHOA."

However, unlike a normal HOA, the only thing that this one does is it administered a bulk-billing contract with
Verizon to provide internet service to all members of the HOA.
The members are charged HOA fees to cover the cost of the contract,
but also for HOA operating costs including professional management fees, insurance, legal fees, etc.
Now the contract with Verizon is ended and will no longer be renewed.

For additional context, the community has a "normal" HOA, called the Broadlands HOA. This HOA handles normal HOA
responsibilities, such as
contracts for garbage collection, landscaping in common areas, and managing common properties such as pools and
building.
Southern Walk is a subset of the Broadlands community that also has the SWHOA as a second HOA.
The Broadlands HOA and SWHOA are separate legal entities.

This project relates to the SWHOA and not the Broadlands HOA.

# Goals

I am on the HOA board of directors, and I am seeking to dissolve the association.
This will require 80% of the membership to vote to agree to dissolution.
Members include all homeowners. Some homes have multiple owners. Some have absentee owners who are renting their home.
I want to start a campaign to create awareness and get people to vote to dissolve the association.

# Challenges

Some difficulties with getting this large supermajority of votes are that many homeowner members are:

1. not fully aware of the situation with the termination of the Verizon contract
2. don't understand that the SWHOA is no longer doing anything useful, but has to charge them fees as long as it exists
3. ignoring communications sent via emails, regular mail, and posted in on-line forums
4. not attending HOA membership calls, and not reading notices about them
5. confused about the difference between the purpose of the SWHOA vs the Broadlands HOA.

# Organization

I am heading a committee to work on getting votes to dissolve the SWHOA.
To try to get engagement from the membership,
I plan to have committee members go door-to-door to talk to SWHOA members.

# Needs

1. I need to be able to assign houses for volunteers to canvas to engage SWHOA homeowner members to understand the
   situation and to vote.
2. I need help to track engagement with SWHOA members and progress toward getting 80% of votes.
